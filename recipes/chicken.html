        <h3>Sweet, Tangy, and Zesty!</h3>
        <p> Technically, this Greek chicken marinade is only 5 ingredients,
             if you donâ€™t count the salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>Some of the more prominent ingredients includes yogurt, which gives
            the chicken some character making it very juicy. The other major ingredient in this
            recipe is is the lemon. The acid from the lemon also helps break down the tough fibers of the chicken as it adds a flavorful zip to each bite. Adding the zest of one
            lemon to the marinade amps the flavor up even that much more.
