Custom recipe webpage
In this project I was tasked in creating a basic recipe website.
This project allowed me to exercise basic html concepts. 
Through the use both absolute and relative links, I was able to direct users to the source of my information and along my own website. 
I used elements of img src to display images found on the web. 
Although I am not completely proficient at it, I became more familiar and with the terminal and use of git to stage and commit changes.
